# NFT Gating

Welcome to the NFT Gating repository! This project introduces the concept of NFT gating, utilizing Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) for authentications to grant access to specific content and data. The application is built using the full-stack BERN (Blockchain, Express, React, and Node) framework. It features distinct pages and content, and it utilizes NFT ownership to provide access to confidential data and messages. This README provides an overview of the NFT Gating application, installation instructions for necessary dependencies, and an explanation of its functionalities.

Users with the required NFTs gain entry to secret data and messages, ensuring privacy and data integrity.

## Features

- Utilize NFT ownership to authenticate users and grant access to restricted content.
- Employ a full-stack BERN application structure to ensure secure and efficient operations.
- Create distinct pages and content that are accessible only to NFT owners.
- Leverage the Ethereum blockchain for secure and transparent NFT management.
- Enhance user experience with a dynamic and intuitive React front-end.
